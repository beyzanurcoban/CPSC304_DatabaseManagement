# CPSC304_Project
milestone 3

# How to run
You need to have a SDK setup for your project as well as have added the Oracle driver under resources as a driver dependency. The program's main entry point is in AdminController. Login with a username and password according to your UBC oracle account. Every setup step is detailed in the link below.

You also need to run our SQL script [databaseSetup.sql](sql.scripts/databaseSetup.sql) on the UBC DB Oracle server to create the table dependencies before running the program.
